From url: inspect

1) create a D2WContext with an EO containing a PK
2) will mount see that the previous is missing
3) RegisterPreviousPage



From menu: new

1) create previous with new EO
2) setPage goes through Main but which is designed to create a new D2WContext..
   and EO Cannot be created here because it need to be inserted in the cache (can only be done by Circuit)
   
==> new goes through the router ==> No eo created only None ==> D2WEditPage create an eo, register and set previous
==> through router the eo is a pk
